The frontend is served via a docker container behind the gateway from our server
Oauth2.0 : manage access to resources instead of needing access info from user(protect by role), 
it delegates this tasks to other servers eg. for security we use keycloak(cryptography, authentication etc)





====================================================================================
What is OAuth 2.0 and how it works?
The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework is a protocol that allows a user to grant a third-party web site or 
application access to the user's protected resources, without necessarily revealing their long-term credentials 
or even their identity.

JPA: a tool that manages relational data in java apps. save,delete, find data


let's talk about the MS that we've implemented
9 microservices that interact with eachother in our application
each microservice performs CRUD operations using REST APIs and this allows it to do actions such as adding, deleting, updating and 
retreiving entities. Each MS uses either MySQL DB with JPA or MongoDB with MongoRepository.
I will present you the first four MS and my colleague will present the other 5

Client Service. As a banking app, we need to manage clients & their data. For instance, we need to add a client to the DB once he registers. 
Update the client when he adds an account and retreive and display his information from the DB on his profile.
The client MS is responsible for all of these operations. And of course, it contains information like:
firstname, lastname, address, phone#, email.
a client can have 2 types of accounts:
and he can add recipients to whom he can transfer money
he can also add credit cards 


Credit Card Service, it manages the information of the Credit card companies as well as their products.
Information about the company can be like the company name or its products list
Information about the products can be the expiry date, or product type: like visa, mastercard or amex.
So it's also responsible for displaying some of these information in the application and it can do other operations
like adding new products or editing them.


Admin is another type of user and he has more priviliges than a client. This microservice is responsible for managing the admin information,
again the basic stuff: name, phone#, address, so on and so forth. But it also communicates with other MS like the client MS.
And it does this by calling the methods of the client MS and this allows it to manage the clients
For example, an admin can perform actions like deleting or updating clients and even cc accounts. It can also add institutions and payees


Authentication Service. This MS allows the users to authenticate themselves, to log in to their accounts.
There are 3 types of users: admins, clients and credit card companies. So, the Authentication Service has
to communicate with these 3 MS. And when a user registers, let's say as an admin, then the Authentication Service
calls the addAdmin method in the Admin MS and the admin is registered and added to the DB.
The technology used in this MS is KeyCloak. KeyCloak is very useful and secure tool that allows to register & authenticate 
users with not a lot of code.
